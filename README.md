# Jarvis_AI_Virtual_Assistant

JARVIS AI is an intelligent, voice-controlled virtual assistant built using Python. It is designed to automate tasks, answer queries, and perform real-time operations such as opening applications, searching the web, and controlling system functions. The assistant features a PyQt5-based graphical interface, speech-to-text capabilities, and integrates with APIs to deliver a seamless, interactive experience.

Key Features:
Voice Command Recognition – Understands and executes commands using speech recognition.
Text-to-Speech Output – Provides responses and confirmations through a natural voice.
App & File Launcher – Opens installed applications and files dynamically without hardcoding links.
Web Automation – Performs Google searches, opens YouTube, LinkedIn, or any website on command.
AI-Powered Automation – Uses APIs (like Groq API) for smart responses and content generation.
GUI Integration – Built with PyQt5, featuring microphone control and a clean, interactive design.
Real-time Information – Fetches weather updates, news, or system information.
Custom Commands – Supports user-defined commands for enhanced personalization.

Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3, PyQt5, Webbrowser, OS, Groq API (for AI tasks)
APIs & Automation: Groq API, Web scraping tools (if applicable)
Voice Engine: pyttsx3 / gTTS

How It Works:
Voice Input: The assistant listens to voice commands using the microphone.
Command Processing: The command is analyzed and mapped to predefined or dynamic actions.
Action Execution: It performs tasks like launching apps, searching the web, or answering queries.
Voice Response: It gives audio feedback and results using text-to-speech synthesis.
