Here's a song I came up with:

**Title:** "Shine Your Light"

**Verse 1:**
In the darkest of nights, when the stars are few
I see your face, and my heart starts anew
You're the beacon of hope, in a world so cold
Your love is the fire, that makes my heart unfold

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it guide me through
In your eyes, my heart beats true
Shine your light, and I'll follow you
Together we'll rise, to a brand new view

**Verse 2:**
Life can be tough, and the road can be long
But with you by my side, I know we'll be strong
You're the melody, that fills my soul
With you, I know, we'll make it whole

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it guide me through
In your eyes, my heart beats true
Shine your light, and I'll follow you
Together we'll rise, to a brand new view

**Bridge:**
We'll dance under the stars, on a night so bright
Our love will shine like a beacon, in the dark of night
We'll chase our dreams, and make them real
With you, my heart, my love will always feel

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it guide me through
In your eyes, my heart beats true
Shine your light, and I'll follow you
Together we'll rise, to a brand new view

I hope you enjoy this song!
