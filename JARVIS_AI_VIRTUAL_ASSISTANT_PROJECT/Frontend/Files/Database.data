Jarvis : It appears you've provided a command to run a Python script using a virtual environment. 
Here's a breakdown of the command:
* `&` is used to run the command in the background.
* `D:/Final_Jarvis_DE_Sem6_project/.venv/Scripts/python.exe` is the path to the Python executable within a virtual environment named `.venv` located in the `D:/Final_Jarvis_DE_Sem6_project/` directory.
* `d:/Final_Jarvis_DE_Sem6_project/Main.py` is the path to the Python script file `Main.py` located in the `d:/Final_Jarvis_DE_Sem6_project/` directory.
When you run this command, it will execute the `Main.py` script using the Python interpreter from the virtual environment.
